This project is a high-performance, header-only C++ image processing library offering a suite of real-time operations, including blurring, resizing, channel manipulation, geometric transformations, and morphological filtering. It emphasizes modularity, SIMD/CUDA-ready extensibility, and aims to serve as the foundational backend for modern photo or video editing pipelines. 

Only scalar single-threaded implementations are implemented, it will be updated once the associated Blog is released.
