This project is a scalar, header-only C++ image processing library offering a suite of real-time operations, including blurring, resizing, channel manipulation, geometric transformations, and morphological filtering. It emphasizes modularity, SIMD/CUDA-ready extensibility, and aims to serve as the foundational backend for modern photo or video editing pipelines. 


Only scalar single-threaded implementations are implemented/are being implemented. All of the major kernels will then be benchmarked and optimized one by one end-to-end. Check back later!
